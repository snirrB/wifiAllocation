Architecture Overview Document for wifi router
***********************************************

Introduction:
This document describes the architecture ofa WiFi access point set up using a Raspberry Pi 5, RaspAP, and NoDogSplash.
The purpose of this setup is to provide a controlled WiFi network where users can connect and interact through a 
captive portal before accessing the internet.

Hardware Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi with Network Interface Card (internal/external): serves as the hardware base for the WiFi access point and mange all the coonection to the wifi.
* Main router: router with internet connection
* Ethernet Cable / additional Network Interface Card : For internet connection to the main router.

Software Components:
* Raspberry Pi OS lite : The operating system for the Raspberry Pi.
* RaspAP: A software package that provides a wireless access point.
* NoDogSplash: A captive portal solution that provides a customizable landing page for users connecting to the WiFi network.

Network Setup:
* Internet Connection: The Raspberry Pi connects to the internet via its Ethernet port or through another WiFi network.
* RaspAP Configuration: Configures the Raspberry Pi to broadcast its own WiFi network.
                        This involves setting up SSID, security options, DHCP settings, etc.
* NoDogSplash Integration: Sets up a captive portal that users must interact with before gaining access to the internet.

general Comments:
* We chose to implement the router on a Raspberry Pi because we wanted a plug-and-play solution that can provide both an access point
  and the function of a computer in a single component
